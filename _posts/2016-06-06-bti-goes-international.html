<p>I started with BTI in January. On June 1st, only five months later, I found myself on a fully-funded international plane ride to the Dominican Republic, alongside an assorted group of BTI teammates and their spouses. Why in the world did BTI send us to the DR, you may ask? We returned to the states yesterday, and I think I may have a few of the answers. Before we get to that, let me go through what exactly we were doing hundreds of miles from home.</p>

<h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>

<p>I walked into this experience energized, with no expectations, and wholly unprepared for the grueling emotional workout that awaited. I had signed up a month prior to sponsor a child in the DR, having no notion of what that even meant. I know now that sponsorship costs $38 per month, but I didn't know five days ago, becuase BTI covers the cost if a teammate would like to sponsor a child. All I knew was that it was recommended we bring a backpack - a sort of care package for the child - because we would have the opportunity to meet them and give them things. Since I wasn't sure what to get I pulled a page out of my mother's book and picked up anything I could think of that could possibly be useful - solar things, school things, toiletry things, even a stuffed bunny.</p>

<p>We arrived in the DR and met our guides at the airport. We numbered thirten travellers, some of whom had gone on this trip before. I forgot to mention - this is not the first time BTI has gone to the DR. It's not the second, or even the third. BTI has been doing this particular trip for the better part of a decade. Given that, it's no surprise that most of our group was already pretty comfortable with each other. We hadn't done a thing yet, but I was already starting to get the sense that something special was going to happen in the next few days</p>

<h2>Day 1 - Bayona &amp; Gualey</h2>

<p>The very first thing we did in the DR was something called "A Day in the Life". We went to a place called Bayona, where I was to meet my sponsor child, Sarah. On the bus ride over I learned that only 1% of sponsored children ever meet their sponsor. The norm is to communicate via letter. To visit in person is highly unusual. Our guide went on to share with us that the families we would be visiting had likely known of our arrival for about a month, and that they would have prepared for this event as though it were a special occasion. It <em>is</em> a special occasion, only I didn't know it until the bus ride over. Needless to say, my excitement was rapidly being replaced by some killer nerves. What in the world was this child going to make of me? I was terrified of dissapointing her somehow.</p>

<p>When I finally did meet Sarah, I made sure to give her the stuffed bunny right away. She seemed about as terrified as I felt, and seemed confused about the process of translating from one language to another. Our translator was wonderful. We learned that Sarah's favorite color was pink, and we didn't learn much else. Then it was time for our home visit.</p>

<p>The larger BTI team was visiting four houses, so I wasn't going to be on my own. Sarah's grandma stopped by in their car and drove Sarah to their house, the rest of our group hoofed it the short distance to their home. We learned that Sarah lived with her mother, her grandmother, her younger sister, and her uncle. Grandma seemed middle aged, mom was 20, uncle seemed 10 or 11, and little sis Jaylene was an adorable and precocious 3 years old. Grandma was more relatable than I possibly could have imagined, even though she spoke no english at all. When asked about the greatest difference the Compassion program had made for their family, Grandma responded, "I'm more joyful." It was my first teaching moment in a trip full of them.</p>

<p>The home visit was unexpectedly emotional for me. We spent time in their living room, chatting as the rain drummed contentedly on the roof. We went to the local grocery with them, walking along scenic and charming streets. We cooked a meal with them, and I got to clean some dishes. This lovely family did not seem like they were in hardship. It was only as we heard how food was very expensive for them, and that they were relying on dad to pay for school for Sarah, and he had stopped doing that, that we could get a sense that they needed and wanted help. They welcomed us - these foreign strangers - warmly into their home, showed us how they lived, where they slept. I've experienced nothing like it before. These are not the DC poor that can be seen begging on street corners. If anything, this family seemed only to want us to know them, to see them, and to understand them. I know I'll not be forgetting them anytime soon.</p>

<p>That afternoon we went to Gualey - one of the most dangerous areas in the DR. We had almost as many guides as we did group members. They served the secondary purpose of keeping us safe. Gualey did not feel safe in any way. The people seemed hostile, and the environment itself was treacherous. We climbed down steep, treacherously slippery steps to get there - steps that residents must traverse while holding heavy water jugs or while holding their babies. The area does not smell very nice, and it's crowded. There were people everywhere, and none of them seemed happy to see us. I couldn't wait to leave the area, and at the same time my heart was breaking, because the scowling people we walked past would not be able to do the same.</p>

<p>Our team dinners and long bus rides made all the difference on this trip. Every single person on this trip was willing to share and to listen. Having that support allowed me to deal with and process the emotional drops without falling apart.</p>

<h2>Day 2 - San Cristobol</h2>

<p>Today was so much fun! When we arrived the community had a show prepared for us - singing and dancing. It was a wonderful contrast from the previous day. We had a tour of the water plant that BTI funded, the water plant that's brought clean water to an area that perviously had none. The little ones that used to get sick are now safe from water-borne illness. And then we got to play baseball with the community. I impressed the baseball coach (and myslef) by hitting two for two for our team.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we went on home visit #2. My work mentor, Chris, also sponsors a child. Chris went on this trip last year. This year, I got to meet Chris' sponsored child, Josias.
